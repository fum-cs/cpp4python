1.  Like Python, C++ supports the use of functions.
2.  In C++, a function definition requires a name, a group of
    parameters, a return type, and a body.
3.  Non-fruitful functions in C++ must contain the keyword `void` in its
    function definition.
4.  You can pass variables by value as well as by reference in C++
    functions. Passing by reference utilizes the use of pointers.
5.  Pass by reference is useful when you require a function to return
    multiple variables.
6.  To pass an array to a function you need to use an array parameter.
    The array parameter is denoted by the array variable name followed
    by set of square brackets (\[ and \]).
