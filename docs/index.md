# C++ for Python Programmers

This short ebook is intended to help Python programmers or students with
at least one term of Python programming experience learn the basics of
the C++ programming language.

This book is written using the build on what you know philosophy. In
order to help you learn C++ we will start with a Python example and then
implement the example in C++. We will also examine the strengths,
weaknesses, and differences between these two languages. As such, this
book does not attempt to replace the many good C++ reference books that
are available. Please feel free to use this book for yourself, or as a
resource for a course you are teaching.

This ebook is published using a Creative Commons license to encourage
you to use it, change it, and modify it for your own purposes. We would
appreciate knowing what you think if you do use this book, and we would
love to see any modifications or additions you make. Please, Fork Me!

## Acknowledgements

<https://www.berea.edu/csc/faculty-and-staff/dr-jan-pearce/> Many thanks
to Runestone for creating a very strong framework for open source
computing books. Many thanks also to Berea College\'s Labor Program for
making it possible for students to undergraduate students to receive
funding to contribute.

Some sections of this book were originally written by Dr. Brad Miller as
*Java for Python Programmers*. These were translated to the C++ language
by Dr. Jan Pearce and a team of excellent students from Berea College.
Other sections were originally written as course web pages by Dr. Jan
Pearce.

We would like to extend a special note of gratitude to [Jesse
Walker-Schadler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-walker-schadler-a4898916b)
who had the vision to create the [CTurtle
library](https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle) which makes graphing in
C++ particularly easy for Python programmers because it used the Python
Turtle library syntax, and for his excellent work in porting it to
Runestone.
